Known bugs in xvi 2.51
======================

* UTF-8 characters are not supported so on recent Linux systems,
  accented characters display as \303\250.

* If it runs out of RAM, often it is unable to save the file.

* It doesn't recognise multiple commands separated by | on the :command line

* :@ and :* with a line range only execute the ex commands in the named buffer
  for the last line. They should execute them for each line in the range.

* Undo does not work properly when applied to macros (either @ or :map);
  it should undo all the changes made by the macro, but in fact only the
  last command within the macro is undone.

* On Unix, pressing Control-\ makes xvi dump core immediately.
  Whether it should or not, as that key generates SIGQUIT, is unclear.

* When you try to open more files than will fit on a screen with an odd number
  of lines (e.g. xvi -s autosplit=100 *.c) all except the first open at line 2.

* :abbreviate and :unabbreviate are not implemented.

* On NetBSD with "make check", all tests seem to succeed but
  in reality none are run.

* The internal codes for special keys (arrow keys, Home, End etc) are
  0x80-0x8C, which are the same as some accented characters on MSDOS so,
  for instance, down arrow inserts an a-grave and a-grave does down-arrow.
  In visual mode this is harmess because only arrow keys are valid as
  commands and only accented characters are valid in insert mode but it
  does mean that you can't use a few accented characters on the command line.
