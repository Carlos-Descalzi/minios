Filename completion on the command line garbles names including spaces

In a directory with files
	Stanotte.ly
	Non lo so.ly
go
	xvi Stanotte.ly
	:b Non*ly
and it says "Inappropriate arguments given"
or
	:b Non[tab]
and it leaves
	:b _Non
(where _ is a space with the cursor on it). The "Non" is
garbage left on the screen and doesn't form part of the
command line.

This seems to be because in unix.c it just passes "echo %s" with the
pattern, so spaces in filenames are indistinguishable from spaces
between filenames. It would be better to use "ls -1" and split on \n
as having \n in filenames is rarer than spaces.
