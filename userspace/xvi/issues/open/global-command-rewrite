The g/re/p mechanism needs rewriting

The "global" mechanism can only apply a limited set of commands [dlps&~]
that it re-implements separately inside exGlobal().

What it should do is mark every matching line in some way, then apply
any command to each marked line, using the same code as is used for
: commands.

POSIX says: "The global, v, and undo commands cannot be used in
	commands. Marked lines may be deleted by commands executed for lines
	occurring earlier in the file than the marked lines. In this case,
	no commands shall be executed for the deleted lines."

See the "if" and commentary at cmdline.c:491 which may be the right place to
implement this.

When this is done, it will be much easier to do colon-@-or-*-with-line-range.
