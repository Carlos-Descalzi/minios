POSIX says:

     * POSIX: "Commands that store text into buffers shall store the text
     * into the unnamed buffer as well as any specified buffer."
     * This only applies to the letter-named buffers, not the automatic ones.

but it's unclear whether just the appended text should be put in the unnamed
buffer or the whole contents of the buffer appended to.
