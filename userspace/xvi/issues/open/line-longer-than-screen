Display of a line that is longer than the screen could be improved

When a line that's longer than will fit on-screen is the current line,
it displays as a column of @ signs down the left edge but the cursor
moves about the screen as if the line were displayed.

Classic vi just maks a mess.
nvi and vim display some of the line (they don't display it as @s)
