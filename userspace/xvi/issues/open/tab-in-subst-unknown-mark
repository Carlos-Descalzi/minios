Tab in replacement text of :s over undefined marks corrupts status line

If you say
	:'m,'ns/, /,^I/
when 'm and (or?) 'n are undefined, as soon as you press the Tab,
the start of the status line is overwritten with "Unknown mark"
and the cursor remains at the end of the status line still to be executed.
When you press Enter, it says "Bad address ranje"

If the marks are both defined, it works OK.
