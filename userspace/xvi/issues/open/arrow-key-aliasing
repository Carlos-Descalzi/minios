Moving left with count prefix to Replace get repetition wrong

Xvi allows you to move left and right within the replacement text
while you are doin an R command, but if there was a repeat count
before the R, inly the part left of the cursor's final position
is repeated, and after the cursor position, not the end of the
replacement text to boot!

The easy solution is to remove the left & right arrow keys from
replace mode.

In classic vi and nvi, pressing an arrow key while in R mode
terminates the replacement and respects a preceding count.
